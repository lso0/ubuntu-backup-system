# System Requirements and Dependencies

## Current System Specifications
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu Linux
- **Storage**: 954GB NVMe SSD (/dev/nvme0n1)
- **Current Usage**: ~18GB
- **File System**: ext4 with EFI boot partition
- **Architecture**: x86_64

## Required Tools

### Pre-installed (should be available)
- `dd` - For disk imaging
- `rsync` - For file system backup
- `tar` - For archive creation
- `sudo` - Root access required
- `bash` - Shell scripting

### May need installation
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install additional tools if needed
sudo apt install -y \
    pv \           # Progress viewer for dd
    gzip \         # Compression
    coreutils \    # Basic utilities
    util-linux \   # Disk utilities
    parted \       # Partition management
    grub-pc-bin \  # GRUB bootloader tools
    grub-efi-amd64 # EFI bootloader (if using UEFI)
```

## Storage Requirements

### Method 1: System Image
- **Space needed**: ~954GB (full disk size)
- **Time estimate**: 2-4 hours
- **Network**: Not required during backup

### Method 2: File System
- **Space needed**: ~20-25GB (current usage + overhead)
- **Time estimate**: 30-60 minutes
- **Network**: Not required during backup

### Method 3: Archive
- **Space needed**: ~5-15GB (compressed)
- **Time estimate**: 15-30 minutes
- **Network**: Not required during backup

## External Storage Options

### Local Storage
- External USB 3.0+ drive (1TB+ recommended)
- Network Attached Storage (NAS)
- Secondary internal drive

### Cloud Storage (for smaller backups)
- Method 2 and 3 can be uploaded to cloud storage
- Consider encryption before uploading
- AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.

## Restore Requirements

### Hardware
- Target system with equal or larger disk capacity
- Compatible CPU architecture (x86_64)
- Sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)

### Software
- Ubuntu Live USB/CD
- Network connectivity (for package updates)
- Target system should support your backup method

## Security Considerations

### Encryption (Optional)
```bash
# Encrypt backup files before storage
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 backup-file.tar.gz

# Decrypt when needed
gpg --decrypt backup-file.tar.gz.gpg > backup-file.tar.gz
```

### Verification
- All scripts include checksum verification
- Test restore process on non-production systems
- Keep multiple backup generations

## Performance Optimization

### For faster backups
- Use SSD storage for backup destination
- Use USB 3.0+ or faster interfaces
- Close unnecessary applications during backup
- Use `ionice` to reduce I/O priority if needed:
  ```bash
  sudo ionice -c 3 ./backup-script.sh
  ```

### For network storage
- Use wired connection when possible
- Consider compression level vs. speed tradeoffs
- Use rsync with SSH for remote backups
